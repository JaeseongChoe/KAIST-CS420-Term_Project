## mini-C

mini-C specification from TA.

## mini-C compiler

### Front end

For lexical and syntactic analyzer, we will use Lex and Yacc using library PLY(Python Lex Yacc).

#### Lexical analyzer

Lex

#### Syntatic analyzer

Yacc

#### Semantic analyzer

### Middle end

Intermediate language generation.

### Back end

Back end of mini-C compiler in ARTIDE has only code generator.

#### Code Generator

Code generator of mini-C compiler in ARTIDE supports only x86 ISA with AT&T syntax.

## mini-C debuger

#### Syntax Handling

#### Run-time error handling

#### Interpretation

#### printf function

#### next command

#### print command

#### trace command

#### Code generation
